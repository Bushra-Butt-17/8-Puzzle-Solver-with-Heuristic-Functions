# 8-Puzzle-Solver-with-Heuristic-Functions
This Python project solves the 8-puzzle problem using heuristic search. It implements the Misplaced Tiles heuristic to guide the search for the goal state. The solver explores possible moves (up, down, left, right) and provides step-by-step output. Future extensions can include Manhattan and Euclidean Distance heuristics.
