# 8-Puzzle Solver with Heuristic Functions

This Python project provides a solution to the 8-puzzle problem using heuristic search techniques. The puzzle involves a 3x3 grid where the goal is to arrange the tiles in a specific order by sliding them into an empty space.

## Features:
- **Misplaced Tiles Heuristic**: Counts the number of tiles not in their correct position.
- **Search Algorithm**: Explores possible moves (up, down, left, right) to solve the puzzle.
- **Step-by-Step Output**: Displays each state as the puzzle progresses towards the goal.

### Future Extensions:
- **Manhattan Distance** and **Euclidean Distance** heuristics for more efficient solving strategies.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `numpy` (if needed)

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bushra-Butt-17/8-Puzzle-Solver-with-Heuristic-Functions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 8-Puzzle-Solver-with-Heuristic-Functions
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the puzzle solver:
   ```bash
   python solve_puzzle.py
   ```

*Note: You can add other dependencies as needed based on your implementation (like libraries for advanced heuristics).*
